            It's a CTF designed to be friendly to beginners. There will be multiple stages with 2 challenges from different areas of computer security. Solving 1 of those challenges will advance you to the next stage. There will be 2 winners: First team solving the last stage + first team solving all challenges.

            How does this relate to the <a href="https://2019.ctf.link/">main 36C3 CTF</a>?

            <dd class="col-sm-8">
            This is a completely separate contest designed for beginners. If you are playing this CTF and
            find it too easy, or you are able to finish all tasks, feel free to try the main CTF! It is way cooler!
