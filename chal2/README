The command:
  strace -eread,write,execve /bin/bash
was executed.
Then vim was installed via apt and the file Flag was opened in vim.
The flag was written in a weird way using little vim shortcuts such as:
  yy p
At the end it was jumped to the beginning of the line:
  gg
Then lines were concatenated via lots of:
  J
Then the cursor moved backwards a couple of times using:
  b
Then a couple of character were changed to upper case using:
  ~
Finally the white spaces were removed by:
  s/ //g

If you simple grep for the read()s you get the following output, which is easy
to read and reconstruct:
