Simple reversing challenge with a constructor and destructor function
and a couple of NOPs in the main function, a fake flag that gets mangled in the
constructor and xor-de with every second byte of a static buffer in the
descructor.
An obvious red herring and a hint - output after main() after 10 seconds - are
included.
